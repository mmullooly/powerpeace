                <p>&quot;Power &amp; Peace: The Global Simulation Game&quot; is a turnless, diceless, real-time
                    geopolitical simulation megagame where players become leaders of up to 26
                    independent nations (A-Z) spread across 4 fictional planets. Nations are tasked with
                    increasing their own prosperity while managing the supply chain of 12 different vital
                    resources (food, iron, oil, etc), all amid a barrage of both natural and geopolitical crises
                    across the game board.</p>
                <p>Simultaneously collaborative and competitive diplomacy — the players’ conversations
                    and negotiations throughout the game — is the core gameplay element. A
                    movement/combat system that synchronizes with the simulation’s “real-time” feel — the
                    planets are slowly but constantly spinning on motorized turntables, and a 5-minute
                    “interval clock” acts like a universal turn counter — create a turnless game where all
                    players can constantly engage in the high-pressure simulation largely without the need
                    of a facilitator.</p>
                <p>The “turnless” format of Power &amp; Peace is revolutionary. Unlike traditional board or
                    strategy games which rely on turn-based systems, Power &amp; Peace utilizes a 5-minute
                    interval clock and continuously rotating planetary surfaces to create an always-active,
                    real-time environment. This enables every participant to remain fully engaged at all
                    times, whether negotiating, managing supply chains, or navigating crises. In doing so,
                    the game mimics the simultaneous demands of real-world leadership and decision-
                    making, preparing students for scenarios that involve time pressure, unpredictability,
                    and the need for adaptive thinking. This is the first in-person geopolitical game to be
                    fully turnless and real-time, a true feat of game design.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the project is an engagement tool allowing for the realities — the pressures,
                    conflicts, and problem solving — of actual geopolitical work to be accessible challenges
                    for youth to actively engage with in a productive (yet fun and engaging) way. The
                    simulation entails fundamental exposure to Earth’s geopolitical challenges — systems
                    theory, supply chains, diplomatic relations, economy management, resource locations,
                    military conflicts, regional idiosyncrasies, etc — in a high-stakes and real-time game
                    format.</p>
