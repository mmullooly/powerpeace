                <p>Founded in October 2024 by James Mullooly, Playbright LLC has developed Power &amp;
Peace, a groundbreaking educational simulation game which transforms how young
people engage with complex geopolitical systems. Combining the immersive elements
of real-time strategy gaming with real-world academic objectives in economics, social
skills, and macro-management, this innovation fills a substantial gap in both
educational tools and entertainment products on the market. </p>

<p>James Mullooly envisioned a better way for students to interact with the world’s toughest
challenges — then built a team, company, and product to make that vision real. Mullooly’s
academic and creative background is uniquely suited to inventing an innovation of this scope.
His coursework in leadership, diplomacy, arts entrepreneurship, immersive storytelling, war
and peace studies, and child development reflects a rare synthesis of skills across international
relations, narrative design, education, and game theory. Graduating Summa Cum Laude, his
academic record supports his conceptual vision with intellectual rigor.</p>

<p>Where others have struggled to make geopolitical simulations that are truly educational and
immersive, Mullooly and his team succeeded by designing a real-time, fully simultaneous
game.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional board games, Power &amp; Peace avoids simplifying global politics with turn-
based abstractions. It creates a live geopolitical ecosystem, where 10–100 players can act and
play at the same time. Designing such a novel dynamic system demanded not just game design
talent but a deep understanding of systems thinking, educational psychology, and the process
of innovation. Mullooly pushed old gameplay models further by building an entirely new
infrastructure and data system that could accommodate non-facilitated, turnless, and long-
form play. </p>

<p>Behind this innovation is an exemplary interdisciplinary team. Under Mullooly’s leadership, the
team includes award-winning software designers, computer engineers, and microarchitecture
specialists. He also curated a five-member Advisory Board of national experts in education,
curriculum assessment, commercialization, and game design. This Board includes two veteran
designers of previous geopolitical education games, John Hunter and Ben Lawless. This
strategic network ensures that Power &amp; Peace is being developed not in isolation from, but
with valuable guidance from industry leaders who recognize its disruptive potential.</p> </div>
